  <h1>Projects I've made/worked on: </h1>
  <h3>Here's a list of projects that I've either made, or worked on. They include both GitHub and non-GitHub projects, and will also include things that may not yet be done/got on a long-term hiatus</h3>

  <br />
  <br />

  <p>
    <a href='https://gist.github.com/SeaHay/d964e64b3a2eb1d930eaa56521f6d594' target='_blank'><h2>Hangman</h2></a>
    A python script I'm writing. It does a two player hangman game supporting phrases that include non-alphanumerical characters! (They just won't be able to be solved for...)
    The project started when we did this as an assignment, but instead it was only one iteration each time, you could guess multiple letters, there were no lives, and to top the cake off, you'd have to type in the answer as well to start it.
    Now a check system is in place, there are classic and dynamic lives, and at some point, I hope to have a word bank to draw phrases from for a single player mode.

    <a href='https://gist.github.com/SeaHay/d7ce46a5657099f4557a46da74b5cd68' target='_blank'><h2>Idea Consultancy</h2></a>
    Another python script, this one built for giving answers for any questions you might have when working on any sort of project.

  <p>
    <a href='https://gist.github.com/SeaHay/0e42224fcdb0044db289cbc4cf75f736' target='_blank'><h2>Angle Computation</h2></a>
    A script that takes an angle and outputs coterminal, quadrant, reference and number of rotations. <br />
    Available for use in a console output text menu ('textMenu()'), as well as a Tkinter GUI ('graphicalMenu()') <br />
    The program only supports negative and positive whole number degree angles, but future support may come to angles with decimals, as well as support for radians.
