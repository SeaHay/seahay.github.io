  <h1>Projects I've made/worked on: </h1>
  <h3>Here's a list of projects that I've either made, or worked on. They include both GitHub and non-GitHub projects, and will also include things that may not yet be done/got on a long-term hiatus</h3>

    <a href='https://gist.github.com/SeaHay/1d89603b0897d253066e6ed98219a8b5' target='_blank'><h2>Hangman</h2></a>
    A python script I'm writing. It does a two player hangman game supporting phrases with spaces, however, it's advised you keep it to alphabeticals and spaces only! (maybe hyphens...)
    The project started when we did this as an assignment, but instead it was only one iteration each time, you could guess multiple letters, there were no lives, and to top the cake off, you'd have to type in the answer as well to start it. 
    (These are all issues I hope to address!)

    Another python script, this one built for giving answers for any questions you might have when working on any sort of project.
