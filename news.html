  <h4>9/5/18: </h4>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Redid the logo</li>
    </ul>
    Also gave <a href='cg.htm'>cg</a> a logo link, since it didn't have one apprently.
  </p>

  <h4>8/31/18: </h4>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Went back and updated bits and pieces of the site</li>
      <li>Added a template for these update logs so I can make them slightly easier</li>
      <li>Added a <a href='cg.htm'>code golf</a> page, where I attempt to be good at something I'm not</li>
    </ul>
    Although I've left this place alone for a while, I do plan on filling it and making it look nicer. Thank you for showing up to a small site that doesn't matter and I'll post again soon! <br /><pre>    -SeaHay</pre>

<h4>12/7/17: </h4>
<p><ul>
<li>Added the gist Ideation Consultancy to projects. </li>
</ul></p>

<h4>12/6/17: </h4>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Updated some of the code on Hangman; not here yet. Been trying to get Atom's Hydrogen to run it but apprently Python grammer doesn't have a kernal, or something along those lines. (pretty much just working on the guessing and lives system right now, and I think I thought of a better way to do things)</li>
	</ul>
	<span style="color:#FDCF90; font-size:.5em;">In case I forget, I could just run a for loop check instead of pulling the indexes of the letters, since all that matters is that we know what letters to reveal. <br /> also add a letters guessed space</span>
</p>

  <h4>12/5/17: </h4>
  <p>
    <ul>
