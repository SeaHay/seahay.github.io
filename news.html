  <h1>What's the news?</h1>

  <h4>7/17/19: </h4>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>So I plan on actually posting some BASH code...</li>
    </ul>
    I found that a run command for my custom scripts that didn't need input was extremely useful in my UNIX course, so I'll be posting the code here when I think it's fool-proof. Basically, what I need to do to get it ready for that is
      <ul>
        <li>Make my code more user-friendly (currently I don't have any input filteration)</li>
          <li>Consult actual experts on possible security risks with my script (I never learned of any issues that may arise with dodgy code but I'm almost certain there's something that's bad about my script)</li>
            <li>Build an installer (The script is looking for a ~/quikscripts/ folder that I can almost guarantee you don't  have)</li>
              <li>Make sure <i>*that*</i> doesn't have any issues with installing my script (again, dodgy code)</li>
      </ul>
      and that's (hopefully) all!
      <br />
      I don't intend on updating this site until that's either done or abandoned so don't stay tuned!
      <br /><br />
      ...On a side tangent, I don't intend on updating the Hangman script for single-player mode, as I don't remember much of my Python, but if I do, I will attempt to add that word bank.

  <h4>5/14/19: </h4>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>I did a UNIX course (and also neglected updating this site)</li>
    </ul>
    So I plan on posting some of the programs I made for peeps who want them, because BASH is a pretty good shell.
    Also, I said I'd be updating the site more, so don't expect that since I left it silent for multiple months...
  </p>

  <h4>11/14/18: </h4>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>There's a guestbook now!</li>
    </ul>
    Either I'll keep it, get a different one, or find out how to make my own.
  </p>

  <h4>9/5/18: </h4>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Redid the logo</li>
    </ul>
    Also gave <a href='cg.htm'>cg</a> a logo link, since it didn't have one apprently.
  </p>

  <h4>8/31/18: </h4>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Went back and updated bits and pieces of the site</li>
      <li>Added a template for these update logs so I can make them slightly easier</li>
      <li>Added a <a href='cg.htm'>code golf</a> page, where I attempt to be good at something I'm not</li>
    </ul>
    Although I've left this place alone for a while, I do plan on filling it and making it look nicer. Thank you for showing up to a small site that doesn't matter and I'll post again soon! <br /><div class="signature"><pre class="signature">-SeaHay</pre></div>
  </p>

<h4>12/7/17: </h4>
<p><ul>
<li>Added the gist Ideation Consultancy to projects. </li>
</ul></p>

<h4>12/6/17: </h4>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Updated some of the code on Hangman; not here yet. Been trying to get Atom's Hydrogen to run it but apprently Python grammer doesn't have a kernal, or something along those lines. (pretty much just working on the guessing and lives system right now, and I think I thought of a better way to do things)</li>
	</ul>
	<span style="color:#FDCF90; font-size:.5em;">In case I forget, I could just run a for loop check instead of pulling the indexes of the letters, since all that matters is that we know what letters to reveal. <br /> also add a letters guessed space</span>
</p>

  <h4>12/5/17: </h4>
  <p>
    <ul>

      <li>Created two new pages:
        <ul>
          <li>Projects</li>
          <li>News</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Added the Gist, Hangman</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
